- **Hyphenation**: Historical papers often used "Foot-ball", "Grand-stand"
- **16 VFL/AFL premierships**: Equal most with Essendon and Collingwood
- **Ground names**: Princes Park → Optus Oval (1994) → Ikon Park (current)
- **Still training base**: Carlton still uses Ikon Park for training and AFLW
