## Critical Findings

### 1. Contemporaneous Redevelopment Articles (2005-2012)

Found via "Kangaroos Arden Street redevelopment" search in Trove:

| Title | Year | URL | Significance |
|-------|------|-----|--------------|
| "Making over the grand old grounds of Victorian football" | 2005 | https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/145174895 | Early redevelopment planning |
| "Kangaroos renew their heart at Arden Street" | 2009 | https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/162116703 | Redevelopment announcement |
| "Finally, North Melbourne's promised redevelopment gets the green light" | 2009 | https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/162199575 | Funding approval |
| "AFL icon receives 21st century makeover" | 2011 | https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/193094254 | Construction progress |
| "New-look base gives Roos lift" | 2012 | https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/193098636 | Completion |

**Note:** These are book/article records in Trove's collection, not digitised newspapers. Full text may require library access.

### 2. Heritage Assessments Found

| Title | Year | URL | Notes |
|-------|------|-----|-------|
| "North and West Melbourne Heritage Study" | 1999 | https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22704050 | Allom Lovell & Associates |
| "City of Melbourne Heritage Review" | 2006 | https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/34891802 | Lovell Chen Architects |

**Significance:** These are the key heritage assessments covering the period immediately before the 2008-2009 redevelopment. They document what heritage value was recognised (or not) for elements subsequently demolished.

### 3. VHD Heritage Status Confirmation

**Searches for "North Melbourne Recreation Reserve" and "Arden Street grandstand" returned:** No direct heritage registration found.

**Key Finding:** The Arden Street Oval/North Melbourne Recreation Reserve is NOT individually listed on the Victorian Heritage Register (VHR). Any heritage protection would be via local Heritage Overlay (HO) in the Melbourne Planning Scheme.

**Related VHD entries found (not directly Arden Street):**
- North Melbourne Town Hall
- Meat Market Arts Centre
- Various North Melbourne residential heritage places

### 4. GA HAP Aerial Photography (Pre-1996)

**Available SCANNED aerials showing Arden Street Oval:**

| Year | Film | Run | Frame | Status | Download URL |
|------|------|-----|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1976 | VIC2050 | 1 | Multiple | SCANNED | Available via GA HAP |
| 1981 | VIC2341 | 2 | Multiple | SCANNED | Available via GA HAP |

**Note:** GA HAP coverage ends 1996. No aerial photography available for 2006-2010 demolition period through this source.

**Coordinates searched:** lat=-37.7988, lon=144.9396, radiusKm=1

### 5. PROV Archival Records (1910-1925 Era)

**13 digitised records found** for North Melbourne Recreation Reserve:

| Series | Description | Era | IIIF Available |
|--------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| VPRS 3183 | Council correspondence files | 1910-1925 | Yes |

**Content includes:**
- Council meeting minutes
- Recreation reserve management correspondence
- Historical photographs (some digitised)

**Limitation:** PROV records from 2000s era not yet transferred or accessible.

### 6. Historical Newspaper Coverage (Pre-1954)

**"North Melbourne turnstiles Arden" search revealed:**

| Article | Date | Significance |
|---------|------|--------------|
| "CROWD GAINS FREE ADMISSION. Arden-street Gate Forced Open" | 1924 | Documents existence of turnstiles/gates at Arden Street |
| "Crowd Break Gate" | 1924 | Additional coverage of same incident |

**Note:** These 1920s articles confirm ticket gates/turnstiles existed historically at Arden Street, but predate the structures demolished in 2008-2009.

---

## Gaps Identified

### Critical Gaps

1. **No contemporaneous newspaper coverage of demolition**
   - Trove's digitised newspapers end ~1954 (copyright restrictions)
   - Modern (2000s) newspaper articles not accessible via Trove newspapers

2. **No PROV records for 2000s era**
   - State archives have 20-30 year transfer lag
   - 2003-2010 City of Melbourne files not yet in PROV

3. **No aerial photography for demolition period**
   - GA HAP coverage ends 1996
   - 2006-2010 aerials would require alternative sources (Nearmap, council)

4. **No Henderson Pavilion-specific documentation**
   - Minimal mentions across all sources
   - May require direct NMFC archives or City of Melbourne FOIA

5. **No GHAP placename entries**
   - Recreation reserves generally not in historical placenames database

### Potential Follow-Up Sources

1. **City of Melbourne archives** - Direct FOIA request for planning permits
2. **NMFC club archives** - May hold internal documentation
3. **State Library Victoria newspapers** - Non-digitised post-1954 newspapers
4. **Nearmap/aerial providers** - Commercial aerial imagery 2006-2010
5. **Melbourne Planning Scheme** - Heritage Overlay (HO) provisions
6. **National Archives of Australia** - If federal funding involved

## Research Methodology Notes

### Search Strategy
- Executed 60+ queries across 8 data sources
- Ran Trove queries with and without phrase quotes
- Used coordinate-based geospatial search for GA HAP
- Cross-referenced VHD heritage database

### Data Source Limitations
- **Trove newspapers:** Digitised collection ends ~1954 due to copyright
- **PROV:** 20-30 year transfer lag for modern records
- **GA HAP:** Coverage 1928-1996 only
- **GHAP:** Historical placenames, not modern recreation reserves
- **Museums Victoria/NMA:** Collections focus, not documentation

### Coverage Period
- Historical coverage (pre-1954): Good newspaper coverage
- Mid-century (1950-1996): Aerial photography available
- Modern era (2000s): Limited to book/article records in Trove, heritage assessments
