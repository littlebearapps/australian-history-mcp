- **Hyphenation**: Historical papers often used "Foot-ball", "Grand-stand"
- **Only one VFL premiership**: 1966 remains St Kilda's only flag
- **1971 "Touched"**: Controversial grand final loss to Hawthorn - Barry Breen's rushed behind was ruled touched
- **Record crowd**: 51,370 at Moorabbin debut in 1965 (still a suburban ground record)
- **Shared ground**: Junction Oval also used by St Kilda Cricket Club
