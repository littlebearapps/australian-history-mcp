## Notes

- **DISAMBIGUATION ESSENTIAL**: "Melbourne" is extremely common in archives - always pair with "Football Club", "Demons", or VFL context
- **OCR variations**: Historical newspapers may show Melbourme, Melborne (OCR errors)
- **Hyphenation**: Historical papers often used "Foot-ball", "Grand-stand"
- **Oldest club**: Founded May 1859 - predates codification of the rules
- **Tom Wills**: Key figure in creating Australian football - his letters appear in 1858
- **Nickname evolution**: Fuchsias → Redlegs → Demons (1933)
- **MCG tenants**: Melbourne has played at MCG since 1889 - longer than any other club
- **13 VFL/AFL premierships**: Most successful 1950s-60s (6 premierships in 9 years)
