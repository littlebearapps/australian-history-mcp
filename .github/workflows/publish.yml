# Publish to npm using OIDC Trusted Publishing
#
# Publishes the package to npm when a version tag is pushed.
# Uses GitHub Actions OIDC for authentication - no NPM_TOKEN needed.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Configure trusted publisher on npmjs.com package settings
# 2. Set: org=littlebearapps, repo=australian-history-mcp, workflow=publish.yml
#
# Usage:
#   npm version patch  # or minor/major
#   git push origin main --tags
#
# Security: Uses OIDC tokens (short-lived, scoped) instead of long-lived secrets.
